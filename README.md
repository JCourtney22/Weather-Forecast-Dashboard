# Weather-Forecast-Dashboard

The User Story for this task was: As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly. Since I have been put into a project group, this task was a great opportunity to develop my teamworking and communication skills further. I was given the opportunity to share my screen and work with the group to produce a pseudocode of the task. We worked together to break the task down into manageable steps and we all offered ideas as to what type of code we might need and when. I then shared the finished pseudocode so that each individual could work on it themselves.

Here is the pseudocode file, where you can see that some items have been crossed through to show when they have been completed before I have added to this README.
